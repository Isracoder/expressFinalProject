# Express Bootcamp Final Project  ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¤ž    


Final Project for the 100 day long intensive express and aws training by gsg. 


## Online Library and Book Review Website ðŸ“–ðŸ«€

##### Project Overview
My goal is to create a website that functions as a mix between other popular book collection 
websites (ex : Goodreads) and a local library website. My project should show books when you search for them 
and whether or not they are available in any nearby libraries (public or otherwise) ðŸ“–ðŸ“œ
