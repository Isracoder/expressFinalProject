# Express Bootcamp Final Project ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¤ž

Final Project for the 100 day long intensive express and aws training by gsg.

## Online Library and Book Review Website ðŸ“–ðŸ«€

##### Project Overview

My goal is to create a website that functions as a mix between other popular book collection
websites (ex : Goodreads) and a local library website. My project should show books when you search for them
and whether or not they are available in any nearby libraries (public or otherwise) ðŸ“–ðŸ“œ

The Project should :

- Handle errors and include Unit tests
- Optomize Performance
